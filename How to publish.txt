How to publish?

1. Publish GraviddleServer as folder (Target runtime: Portable)
2. Publish CompositionRoot as folder (Target runtime: Portable)
3. Copy-paste CompositionRoot publish into GraviddleServer publish
*When pasting, skip duplicate files (use GraviddleServer files)*
4. Important: change web.config file. Change arguments=".\GraviddleServer.dll" to arguments=".\CompositionRoot.dll"

Done :)
